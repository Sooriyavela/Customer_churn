# Customer Churn Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for analyzing customer churn data. The project aims to understand the factors influencing customer churn and to build predictive models to identify customers at risk of leaving.

## Project Overview

Customer churn refers to the loss of customers over a given period. By identifying key patterns and predicting churn, businesses can implement strategies to retain their customers and improve satisfaction.

### Goals:
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into customer behavior.
- Visualize the relationships between features and churn rates.
- Build predictive models to classify customers as churned or not churned.

## Features

### Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data cleaning and handling missing values.
- Summary statistics and distribution analysis.
- Visualizations:
  - Correlation heatmaps.
  - Histograms and boxplots for numerical features.
  - Bar charts for categorical features.

### Predictive Modeling
- Feature engineering and selection.
- Model training using algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
